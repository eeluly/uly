    ght your way to Paradise. birthday ribbons into this night
    NOW WHOSE IS THAT SHRIEKING
    must be one of our dead coming home
    with cold goss & lovers’ laurel
    directing their heiress pleasure flowers to no one again

    what do you do with a dead

    give the rose a twin / “ NEVER ”
    why do you keep the dead treats the dead loan you
    this small pock / that aberration

    where do you stash your pray
    your patterns
    the dead would love them back
    WE ARE NOT THE SAME
    i am a knocked up sermon & u r
    an utterance
    lost in the pleiades’
    light-hole

    nothing in this speech but a hemorrhage
    nothing that amounts to voice

    o voice
    o riddle
    o quantum meruit exit
    would you set yourself among the moons
    to transgress the continuity
    of their setting on you
    or would you be way too nervous

    “ I’VE BEEN DEPRIVED OF A JOY ”

    i hear you buddy

    brothers generally just beg pardon
    but you are gehenna wet with flame
    and the upturned-eye of all flamers
    you are my singing bell
    swallow one drop of flame
    & fall home
    you chew the poison gum
    “ I DON’T KNOW IF IT’S WRONG ”
    they serve you dainty meats
    and you touch
    your prayer hands
    flame-boasting hammers
    you fill the cup of your blood-eye
    and life-vanishing aperture
    you shout
    and i hear you
    “ THIS FLAME IS KIND OF PALE / WHAT SHALL I DIVINE FROM IT ”
    you cross your acheron heart
    to devour all divination
    and i taste
    your doggy tears
    “ THIS ACT IS NOT MINE ”
    freak name yourself
    apostle stop
    your flame is worse than obdurate
    your garment heart
    your thought is worse than obdurate
    your venerable flame
    you’re extra
    your confused shroud
    your act risen
    and to what end
    what appeal
    what point
    what are you wearing rn
    what books do you read what tv lately
    what coming what going
    what song what sonority
    what sublimation
    why are you out here rejecting martyrdom
    petite boy of the moon
    as often the name will cry out
    as often the pit has appealed
    to this land of no flower
    no fruit / no motorcar / and where the stones are stones
    as often we all have plead / off in our wound

    but judas gets a holiday
    o precious pearl
    as the light has lived
    in the pleiad
    work for the dead and you yourself
    will sparkle
    disturb the cloister with ur noise ur aerial noise
    don’t kid
    and do flame praises
    don’t freak
    o lover / o god
    “ DON’T TRIP, WE’RE ALL GOD’S KIDS ”

    ( & who are the gods
    an elegy / so thoughtful
    i do not doubt its question )

    o lover
    o poser
    o patron saint
